Intro/Oslo as A Tool for Ext DSLs - What is Oslo? Don't ask me!
Background - Show Example Input and Output

The Good (The Parser)
	Intellipad
	Tokens and Syntaxes
	Functional Similarities
		List Generation (The Head and the Tail)	
		Pattern Matching

The Bad (Deserializing)
	Parsing -> Structured Data
	Create AST
	Create or Implement A Tree Walker
	Dev Cycle

The Ugly (Code Generation)
	Using Object Graph with String Manipulation & Regex
	Added NVelocity Templates
	Refactoring from Procedural Code

Wrap-Up/Conclusion - Oslo -> MGrammar Provides some great tooling to create a parser but it would be unsuitable for a number of projects due to the post-parsing work it requires - this may be improved in later CTPs of Oslo.
